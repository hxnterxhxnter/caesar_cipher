# caesar_cipher
simple ascii-based caesar cipher in python
------------------------------------------
- It's not perfect but its good enough, for some simple encrypted data transfer
- Can be used for understanding the caesar algorithm

good luck, have fun ;)

P.S. Would be nice if you send some improvements! :D
